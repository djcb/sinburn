* Sinburn

  Sinburn (=sinburn-theme.el=) is my own version of the [[http://slinky.imukuppi.org/zenburnpage/][Zenburn]] theme for emacs.

  There are quite a few different /zenburn-for-emacs/ versions floating around
  the internet – some of my own, see [[http://emacs-fu.blogspot.com/2010/04/zenburn-color-theme.html][zenburn-for-emacs with the color-theme
  package]], and [[http://emacs-fu.blogspot.com/2010/05/using-zenburn-for-org-mode-generated.html][zenburn-for-emacs-24]].
  
  To (hopefully) reduce confusion, I've renamed my version /Sinburn/, and this
  is where I will do my further customizations.

* Installation

  Note, =sinburn-theme.el= is for Emacs 24 – which is not released /officially/
  yet, but widely used.

  Drop =sinburn-theme.el= somewhere in your custom theme directory (see the
  variable =custom-theme-directory=), and execute =M-x load-theme RET sinburn
  RET=.
